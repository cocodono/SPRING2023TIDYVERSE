#### TidyVerse Assignment: Collaborating Around a Code Project with GitHub.


## Overview

In this assignment we will get to practice collaborating around a code project with GitHub. We will create and example using one or more TidyVerse packages and demonstrate how to use the capabilities.

**We will use a birth dataset from 'fivethirtyeight.com'. This dataset contains U.S. births data for 1994 - 2003 which, is provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) National Center for Health Statistics (NCNS). We will load the data from their GitHub repository.**

#### Load Library

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Load Data

```{r}
us_births <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/births/US_births_1994-2003_CDC_NCHS.csv", header = TRUE)
```

#### Header Defination Table.

## View  Data

*View the dataset*

```{r}
dim_desc(us_births)
```

```{r}
head(us_births)
tail(us_births)
```
*there are 3652obs/rows and 5 variables/columns*

**Now, I will transform the dataset by using functions from the dplyr and ggplot package.**

## dplyr::summerize() & dplyr::sum()

**How many total number of births in the US from 1994-2003?**

```{r}
us_births %>% summarise(total_births = sum(births)) 
```

## dplyr::Groupby(), dplyr::summerize() & dplyr::sum()

**How many total number of births in the US from 1994-2003 each year?**
  
```{r}
Totalbirth<-us_births %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(total_births = sum(births))
Totalbirth
```

## ggplot2::ggplot()

**Showing in graph the total number of births in the US from 1994-2203 each year**

```{r}
ggplot(Totalbirth, aes(x=(year), total_births)) + geom_bar(stat="identity", width = 0.5, color = "black", fill = "lightblue") + labs(x = "Year", y = "Total Births", title = "Total Birth in Each Year 1994-2003") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1, size=8)) + geom_label(aes(label=total_births), position = position_dodge(width = 0.1), size = 3, label.padding = unit(0.1, "lines"), label.size = 0.09, inherit.aes = TRUE)
```

## dplyr::Groupby(), dplyr::summerize() & dplyr::mean()

**What was the average births in the US from 1994-2203 per month?**

```{r}
avg_month <- us_births %>%
   group_by(month) %>%
  summarize(Average = mean(births))
avg_month
```


## dplyr::filter(), dplyr::mutate() & dplyr::select()

**What was the birth rates in a given year (ex: year in 2000)?**

```{r}
births_2000 <- us_births %>%
  filter(year == 2000) %>%
  group_by(month)%>%
  summarise(births = sum(births))%>%
  mutate (birth_rate = round((births/281400000)*10000,2)) # As per CDC, birth rate is calculated by dividing the number of live births in a population in a year by the midyear resident population. Birth rates are expressed as the number of live births per 1,000 population. In 2000, the U.S. Census Bureau counted 281.4 million people in the United States.  
births_2000 
max(births_2000$birth_rate, na.rm = FALSE )
```


## ggplot2::ggplot()

**Showing in graph the birth rate per month in the Year 2000**

```{r}
ggplot(births_2000, aes(x = factor(month), y = birth_rate)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.5, color = "black", fill = "lightblue") +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun",
                              "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec")) +
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Birth rate", title = "Birth Rate Per Month in Year 2000")+
  geom_label(aes(label=birth_rate), position = position_dodge(width = 0.1), size = 3, label.padding = unit(0.1, "lines"), label.size = 0.09, inherit.aes = TRUE)
```

Based on our data set from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the birth rate in the United States in January 2000 was approximately 11.73 compared to December 2000 was approximately 11.97 births per 1,000 population. The highest birth rate in the United States was in August, which was approximately 12.80 births per 1,000 population. It's important to note that birth rates can vary by state and demographic group, so this is an overall national estimate.

## Conclusion

In this assignment we were able to extract dataset from fivethirtyeight.com and use TidyVerse packages, specifically dplyr and ggplot2 to demonstrate it's capabilities. 
We have used dplyr to manipulate our data by using mutate(), select(), filter() and summarise() functions. These all combine with group_by() which allowed us to perform our operation “by group”. We have also used ggplot2 to have a visual representation of our data as it is easier and faster to transmit in our brain.

# EXTENDING GGPLOT ANALYSIS

### INTRODUCTION

To further analyze the births dataset I will look to see if there is any trend in the number of t in the US per month and year from 1994 - 2003. 

Scatter plot of numbers of births over time with best fit line.

```{r}
ggplot(us_births, aes(x = year, y = births)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Number of US Births")
```

The scatter plot of number of US births by year shows that there is an inexplicable paucity of data around 10,000 births in each year per day. It is hard to say whether this is an artifact of data collection or reality. The blue trend line a steadily increase number of births by year over this nine year period. 


I will explore any trend by month, by using a violin plot.

```{r}
ggplot(us_births, aes(x = as.factor(month), y = births, fill = as.factor(month))) +
  geom_violin() +
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Number of US Births") +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun",
                              "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec")) +
  guides(fill = FALSE)
```
The violin plot allows us to see that the distribution is similar across all 12 months, with a long left tails meaning most days have births above 10,000, but a handful of days have births below 10,000. We can also see that there is a slight trend where births spike in the summer and the lowest births are in the winter months especially December.

### CONCLUSION
To conclude, I was able show with a scatter plot that births have been steadily increasing from 1994 - 2003, further with a violin plot as well. I was able to show that across all of the years births spike slightly in the summer months and dip in the winter.
