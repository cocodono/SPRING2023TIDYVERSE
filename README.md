# SPRING2023TIDYVERSE

Spring 2023 Tidyverse create and extend assignments

# Farhana Akther

Initial Description and Links:

In this assignment we will get to practice collaborating around a code project with GitHub. We will be practicing our knowledge of TidyVerse functions by creating vignette examples of the packages. I am using a birth dataset from fivethirtyeight.com. This dataset contains U.S. births data for 1994 - 2003 which, is provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC’s) National Center for Health Statistics (NCNS).

# TIDYVERSE EXTEND:

In the extension part of this assignment I have chose Alic's work and used the TidyVerse package, specifically **dplyr** package to demonstrate it's capabilities.I have used dplyr to manipulate the dataset by using filter(), summarize(), sum(), and mean() functions, combine with group_by() which, allowed us to perform our operation “by group”.


# Waheeb Algabri

Initial Description and Link:

For this assignment, we'll be practicing our knowledge of Tidyverse functions by creating vignette examples of the packages that make up Tidyverse.
In this project, my goal is to create a programming example or “vignette” that showcases the capabilities of a TidyVerse package, along with a dataset from either fivethirtyeight.com or Kaggle. The aim of this example is to demonstrate how to effectively use the selected TidyVerse package to manipulate, analyze, and visualize the selected dataset.

# Taha A

Initial Description and Link:

For this assignment, we'll be practicing our knowledge of Tidyverse functions by creating vignette examples of the packages that make up Tidyverse. In my case, I wanted to attempt going over the forcats package which focuses on manipulating factor elements in a dataframe, as I have no experience with using it at this point.

# Gregg Maloy
TIDYVERSE CREATE

For this assignment dplyr was utilized to conduct a superficial analysis of the 'Music
Dataset : 1950 to 2019' which provides a list of songs 'from 1950 to 2019 describing
music metadata as sadness, danceability, loudness, acousticness, etc.'  More
specifically, dplyr was used to analyze aspects of the 'sadness' variable to demonstrate
the main functions of the dplyr package.  The final product is a playlist of songs between the years 1950-2019 which includes the top one 'saddest' song from each year.

TIDYVERSE EXTEND

The overarching purpose of this assignment was the utilization of github as a collaborative
coding tool to explore push, pull, clone and forking capabilities. 
In this assignment a github repository was cloned, another student's vignette .rmd file
modified and then the .rmd file was pulled back to the original github repository to
demonstrate github's collaboration capabilities.  

The vignette which was modified was created by Jlok17.  The vignette was modified to improve
ggplot readability. More specifically the plot was reordered and observation value labels were
introduced to a scatter plot.

# Glen Davis: Create:
A vignette of example use cases for the purrr library within the tidyverse. 

# Glen Davis: Extend:
gdd - extending Mo's tidyverse create submission - starting lines for changes/comments - 
line 29: combined your string replacements and class coercion into one line
line 35: reordered/simplified your group_by/summarize workflow
line 66: adjusted your bar plot so that the x-/y-values are in more standard positions (i.e. the x is a category, and the y is numeric), your bars are sorted, and then the coords are flipped so you still achieve what you wanted visually: a horizontal bar plot. This is better than setting the y-value as a category and the x-value as numeric and not doing the coord flip, as it's easy to get confused when you do it that way. Also updated your Amounts since you wanted them to represent millions of dollars, not dollars.

# Gabriel Castellanos 

Inital Description:

The purpose of this mardown is to provide an introduction to the following 3 packages: Forcats, Dplyr, and GGplot. This vignette shows how using these 3 packages from the larger tidyverse package can help the user enhance data visuals (using GGPlot).

# Kayleah Griffen

The objective of this assignment was twofold (1) to practice collaborating around a code project with GitHub and (2) to use a capability of tidyverse and demonstrate it with a vignette. The gitHub repository the code was submitted to with a pull request is https://github.com/acatlin/SPRING2023TIDYVERSE. 

The dataset I chose to work with is data that I obtained from working with the Franklin Community Center. The Franklin Community Center is a nonprofit organization that aims to help families and individuals in Saratoga County. They have been in operation for 40 years and their Food Pantry has been operational since 2018. In 2019, the Food Pantry began using the Oasis database to manage their cases. Each family or individual is assigned a case number, and every time a person from the case comes in to receive a service it is documented. I worked with the Oasis team to understand how to extract data from their database. With the data I extracted, my goal is to visualizations showing what parts of NY the food bank services are going to. 

The tidyverse capabilities that I wanted to demonstrate using the dataset are extensions of `ggplot2`. The Simple Features for R, or `sf` package, can be used in conjunction with `ggplot2` in tidyverse to create maps. Additionally the `treemapify` can be used with `ggplot2` to make treemaps. 


# Kayleah Griffen Tidyverse Extend

For the tidyverse extend, I chose to work with Taha's code and to demonstrate more of the functionality of the forcats package.

# Umer Farooq

Initial Description and Link:

The dataset I used was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rahul253801/political-donations-by-american-sports-owners). It contained the amount of political donations given by American sports owners to political campaigns and Political Action Committee organizations. Using dyplyr, stringr, and ggplot2 from tidyverse, I explored various questions from the dataset.

# Shoshana Farber

### Tidyverse CREATE

This vignette demonstrates some of the capabilities of the **tidyr** package from the **tidyverse** suite. It also utilizes **dplyr** and **ggplot2** functions. 

The data set used was from FiveThirtyEight.com and it focused on Elo ratings and other metrics for NBA basketball teams.

### Create
Initial Description and Link:

For this assignment, I will be creating a programming sample vignette to demonstrate the use of the tidyr package in the tidyverse package. I will be working with the “Video Game Sales” (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales) dataset from Kaggle. The dataset was generated from a scrape of vgchartz.com and contains the sales of video games that sold greater than 100,000 copies from 1980 to 2020.

### Extend 
This is my extension to Alex Khaykin's vignette on the `ggplot2` package in the tidyverse. His "Create" assignment looked at key plots in `ggplot2` using the 'congress_age' dataset from fivethirtyeight. So far, he has demonstrated how to create a bar plot, boxplot, violin plot, and a scatterplot. I will expand on this by creating a density plot and histogram as well as showing useful components in the ggplot2 package to improve data visualization.
