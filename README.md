Spring 2023 Tidyverse create and extend assignments

# Waheeb Algabri

Initial Description and Link:

For this assignment, we'll be practicing our knowledge of Tidyverse functions by creating vignette examples of the packages that make up Tidyverse.
In this project, my goal is to create a programming example or “vignette” that showcases the capabilities of a TidyVerse package, along with a dataset from either fivethirtyeight.com or Kaggle. The aim of this example is to demonstrate how to effectively use the selected TidyVerse package to manipulate, analyze, and visualize the selected dataset.

Initial Description and Link:

For this assignment, we'll be practicing our knowledge of Tidyverse functions by creating vignette examples of the packages that make up Tidyverse. In my case, I wanted to attempt going over the forcats package which focuses on manipulating factor elements in a dataframe, as I have no experience with using it at this point.

I've chosen `ggplot2` as my tidyverse package to showcase and worked with a dataset from Kaggle showing the number of internet users for various countries between the years 1980 and 2020.

For this create assignment, I used the following packages and functions to analyze college major dataset from FiveThirtyEight.

| Package   | Function                                                                                                                              |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `readr`   | `read_csv`                                                                                                                            |
| `dplyr`   | `glimpse()` `group_by()` `summarise()` `mutate()`                                                                                     |

I worked using the lubridate package within the Tidyverse ensemble. With this, I created examples exploring NYC Filming Permits data.

# Gregg Maloy
Initial Description and Link:

For this assignment dplyr was utilized to conduct a superficial analysis of the 'Music
Dataset : 1950 to 2019' which provides a list of songs 'from 1950 to 2019 describing
music metadata as sadness, danceability, loudness, acousticness, etc.'  More
specifically, dplyr was used to analyze aspects of the 'sadness' variable to demonstrate
the main functions of the dplyr package.  The final product is a playlist of songs between the years 1950-2019 which includes the top one 'saddest' song from each year.

# Gabriel Castellanos 

Inital Description:

The purpose of this mardown is to provide an introduction to the following 3 packages: Forcats, Dplyr, and GGplot. This vignette shows how using these 3 packages from the larger tidyverse package can help the user enhance data visuals (using GGPlot).

# Kayleah Griffen

The objective of this assignment was twofold (1) to practice collaborating around a code project with GitHub and (2) to use a capability of tidyverse and demonstrate it with a vignette. The gitHub repository the code was submitted to with a pull request is https://github.com/acatlin/SPRING2023TIDYVERSE. 

The dataset I chose to work with is data that I obtained from working with the Franklin Community Center. The Franklin Community Center is a nonprofit organization that aims to help families and individuals in Saratoga County. They have been in operation for 40 years and their Food Pantry has been operational since 2018. In 2019, the Food Pantry began using the Oasis database to manage their cases. Each family or individual is assigned a case number, and every time a person from the case comes in to receive a service it is documented. I worked with the Oasis team to understand how to extract data from their database. With the data I extracted, my goal is to visualizations showing what parts of NY the food bank services are going to. 

The tidyverse capabilities that I wanted to demonstrate using the dataset are extensions of `ggplot2`. The Simple Features for R, or `sf` package, can be used in conjunction with `ggplot2` in tidyverse to create maps. Additionally the `treemapify` can be used with `ggplot2` to make treemaps.

# Umer Farooq

This Vignette is eying at a tidyverse package ggplot2. This purpose of this vignette is to explain how basics of ggplot2 works and how can we make effective graphs. A random data set in the field to healthcare is being picked from Kaggle to plot data using ggplot2

Initial Description and Links:

In this assignment we will get to practice collaborating around a code project with GitHub. We will create, and example using one or more TidyVerse packages and demonstrate how to use the capabilities.

We will use a birth dataset from ‘fivethirtyeight.com’. This dataset contains U.S. births data for 1994 - 2003 which, is provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC’s) National Center for Health Statistics (NCNS). We will load the data from their GitHub repository.
